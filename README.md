My name is Jack, and this is my programming page where I upload all the necessary files and projects that I am working on for my class, COMM-165.  I am currently a student at Lehigh University, and my Major is Population Health, although I am also pursuing a minor in Mass Communications.  Some of my hobbies include reading, hiking, and playing the trumpet.  I also like the occasional karaoke on Fridays.

My ultimate asipration is to become a lawyer and start my own law firm.  If you want to know more about me and my professional experience, please visit my LinkedIn page at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwillard01/
