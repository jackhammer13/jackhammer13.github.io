My name is Jack, and this is my programming page where I upload all the necessary files and projects that I am working on for my class, COMM-165.  I am currently a student at Lehigh University, and my Major is Population Health, although I am also pursuing a minor in Mass Communications.  Some of my hobbies include reading, hiking, and playing the trumpet.  I also like the occasional karaoke on Fridays.
